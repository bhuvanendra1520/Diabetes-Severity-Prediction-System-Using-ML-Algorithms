## In the recent times, diabetes has become one of the most chronic diseases in the world.According to WHO 2014 report, around 422 million people worldwide are suffering from diabetes. If there is a chance for early diagnosis, then the risk factor of diabetes will be decreased significantly. There are lot of research work that had been done in this area and built some prediction models and provided the solution. But the existing methods gave low accuracy and consumed more time for dataset trainin. The main objective of this project is to predict the severity of diabetes with the best accuracy and precision for the dataset. Our proposed work consists of two phases: pre-processing and disease severity prediciton. In the first phase, pre-processing is performed for the BRFSS dataset and in the second phase ML algorithms are used for the disease severity prediction and the best accuracy has been taken into consideration. In this paper we are going to discuss about the brief analysis of the dataset and comparison of various ML algorithms and select which gives the best accuracy and predict whether the patient has diabetes and the severity of the disease.
